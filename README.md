# pandas-challenge
Welcome to my submission for the Pandas-Challenge in module 4 of the Data Analytics bootcamp. This project was completed as part of the curriculum to showcase my proficiency in pandas library and Jupyter notebook, particularly in the context of data analytics.
# Challenge Description
In this challenge, our objective was to create a report using two separate CSV filesâ€”one containing data on school districs and the other containing student data from each said schools.  Below, you'll find the detailed requirements of the challenge.

 # My Analysis
  
Charter schools consistently surpass district schools in both math and overall performance, a pattern that persists across varying school sizes. Smaller student populations tend to correlate with higher overall achievement, while reading scores maintain a steady average across all grades and schools. However, math scores exhibit greater diversity, with underperforming schools averaging around 76%-77% compared to top performing ones at 83%-84%. Interestingly, the top five performing schools operate on smaller budgets per student than the bottom five, yet achieve higher results. These top schools also boast significantly fewer students, ranging from 900 to 2,200, while the lowest performers enroll between 3,000 and 4,000 students. To enhance our analysis, additional data could be included, such as student-to-teacher ratios or staff counts per school. Despite charter schools typically serving academically challenged students, they paradoxically excel in academic performance. This raises questions: Is it the result of smaller class sizes or the adoption of innovative teaching methods? While the data provided may not directly address these questions, it is reasonable to suggest that future spending should prioritize exploring these inquiries, and expanding on the learning methods of the charter schools. 

# Resources Used
 Challenges I drew heavily from include the following:
- The Intro to Binning Challenge
- The Student Census Merging Challenge
- The Census Group By Challenge
- The Comic Books CSV Challenge

 These challenges, in addition to the other challenges provided, were helpful in teaching us the following:

- Importing the pandas library into Juptyer notebooks
- Referencing a CSV file
- Binning Data
- Grouping Data
- Sorting
- Creating a dictionaries

  ## Additional Resources
For syntax that I was not familiar with, such as formating percentages, and returning values, I used resources such as the Xpert Learning Assistant, provided by UC Berkely Bootcamp, Pandas Documentation, and ChatGPT.
